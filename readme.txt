== WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE POINTS AND REWARDS FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN == 

**1) Restrict Rewards Points**: With this feature of the WooCommerce loyalty program plugin, merchants can restrict customers from earning reward points on the purchase of products, that the customers have bought by redeeming their existing reward points.  

**2) Assign Woo Points on Previous Orders**: With the WooCommerce Rewards points plugin, the merchants get a chance to assign Woo points on previous orders. For example, before installing the points and rewards plugin, there might be a lot of orders that customers might be involved with. This setting enables the merchants to assign points to those orders.   

**3) Order Reward Points**: With the WooCommerce point reward system, the admin can select the maximum number of orders for the customers to earn a certain number of points and rewards. For example, if the admin has set the maximum number of orders to 10 and the number of points to 5. Then, the customer will earn 5 points, after successfully ordering 10 times from the website.

**4) WooCommerce Rewards Points on Actions**: With WooCommerce Points and Rewards plugin, customers have the opportunity to earn points for rewards through various activities like:

* **Sign Up:** Merchants can offer reward points and rewards on unique customer sign-ups.
* **Referrals:** When user A shares his referral link and user B signs up using user A’s referral link, user A receives reward points. With the WordPress point system plugin, users can share their referral links on Facebook, Twitter, Email, and WhatsApp directly from their accounts.
* **Total Amount Spent:** Merchants can set the WooCommerce loyalty points for rewards to be credited to the customer’s account against each penny they spend on their store via the conversion feature.
* **On Purchase Of Product:** Merchants can assign global WooCommerce points and rewards value to all simple products of their store so the customer gets the same number of points on the purchase of any product.
* **On A Set Range Of Order Total:** Merchant can set the number of points the customer will get if his order value lies within a set range.

**5) Easy Woo Points Redemption**: In the WooCommerce loyalty program plugin, customers can redeem their Woo points either on the cart or at the checkout page by entering the points in the “Apply Points” field. Merchant can select where he wants to show the “Apply Points” field, on a cart or at the checkout page. He can also set the conversion rule to determine the value of points and rewards using the conversion table feature.

**For Example:** If the order costs $20 and the customer has 10 points in his account, the merchant can determine whether the customer will get a discount of 10, 5, or 2 dollars by redeeming those 10 points.

**6) Membership System For Exclusive Offers**: Merchants can create their own membership system based on the WooCommerce Loyalty Program plugin. This helps them offer exclusive discounts to customers based on the points they collect. Merchants can add discounts on rewards on some categories and their products. If the customer subscribes to the membership, he can purchase those discounted products.

**7) WooCommerce Points Log Report**: In the WooCommerce rewards plugin, the WooCommerce points Log Report feature is available for both customers and the admin:

* **For Customers:** They can check and monitor each point transaction they have done so far. The log table shows the details for each point they earned and redeemed.
* **For Merchant:** They can view the user points history to track the points transaction for each customer. Along with it, they can add or deduct points from any customer’s account using this feature.

Additionally, the admin is provided with hooks through which he can extend and customize the points tab and My Account page. 

**7) Customer Notification Feature**: With the Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin, merchants can notify their customers of each point transaction. Merchants can customize the email subject and message for different notification types. The notification is sent to the registered email of the customer.

**8) WPML Multilingual Compatibility**: The WooCommerce Rewards plugin is compatible with the WPML Multilingual plugin which allows you to reward your customers in your local language.
